## How to add these share buttons
Follow the steps below, to add these light weight sharing buttons on your WordPress site :
1. Open [Lite-WP-Sharing-Buttons](https://theabhishekverma.github.io/lite-wp-sharing-buttons) project.

3. Install a plugin called "WPAdvancedAds" which is mainly used for inserting ads. Use tgis plugin to add that HTML code to beginning and end of the post. You can also do it without installing tjis plugin, if you have some coding knowledge.
